Axpyree - Never let your foods expire again!

## This is my first webapp

I had to come up with one with my partner, Boon Jun, for Project Orbital, a programme offered by my school.
I wanted to solve a very simple problem at home: my family kept letting our groceries and foods expire (unknowingly, of course).
The plan was to come up with a simple webapp that could be used by anyone, even my grandmother, and to have a clear reminder on the homepage warning the user of
any foods expiring.
With just these thoughts and no prior experience in app development, we started our journey.

### Tech Stack

React, Supabase & Netlify (for the hosting)

### INSTRUCTIONS TO USE

**LINK TO AXPYREE** [Axpyree](axpyree.netlify.app/signup)
Feel free to play around with Axpyree and give me any feedback you may have! I do plan to eventually brush up on my CSS/HTML skills so that the frontend looks way nicer...

Also, **you are required to signup with your email and click on the confirmation link sent** before logging in to use Axpyree.
I will enable OAuth in the future, Supabase supports it so that makes it a lot easier for me.

Do note that I wrote the code intending for Axpyree to be viewed on a desktop, so the frontend adjustment might be slightly off if viewed on a mobile device.
